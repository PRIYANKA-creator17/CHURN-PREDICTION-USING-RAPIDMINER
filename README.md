**#Case Study:**
Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict and Reduce Customer Churn for a Telecom Company
Executive Summary:
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and customer churn poses a significant challenge to profitability and growth. Losing a customer not only means lost revenue but also increased costs in acquiring new customers to replace them. This case study focuses on how a telecom company can leverage machine learning models to predict customer churn, analyze the causes behind it, and implement data-driven strategies to retain customers, thus mitigating revenue losses and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.


**Current Business Challenge**
**Problem Statement:**
The company is facing elevated customer churn rates, but without a structured and data-driven strategy, they are unable to proactively address the issue. This has led to:

**Revenue Declines:** A high churn rate negatively affects the company's revenue, necessitating higher customer acquisition costs.
**Inconsistent Customer Retention Efforts:** The absence of targeted strategies results in inefficient marketing campaigns and unfocused retention efforts.
**Unclear Customer Insights:** Without analytics, the company lacks a clear understanding of why certain customers leave and others stay. This makes it difficult to develop tailored offers or engagement programs to retain high-risk customers.
